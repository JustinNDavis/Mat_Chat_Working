#Purpose - the purpose is to create a customer need statement

Product - social media / image board that allows users to share information about specific topics.

The product needed is a website dedicated to discussions of various topics where users are able to post different media types.  The website should have
the possibility to include ads to generate extra revenue.  The different media types allowed should be webms, gifs, pngs, and jpegs.  Each board should 
have clear and precise rules to show what's allowed and why certain threads are deleted or closed.  Different boards should be able to have multiple threads running with
discussions about different topics related to the board.  For example, if the board is dedicated to the discussion of the technology, there could be
3 separate threads about computer processor recommendations for gaming based on $XXX, how monitor refresh rates affect results in first person 
shooter games, and tips for building a computer.

The boards will be structured so that it allows users to start a thread or view others.  Any user can join a thread and participate.  Users will be able
to like or dislike certain comments to give each comment some validity from other users.  At the top of every board there should be the rules posted
allowing users to know immediately what is allowed/expected.  Users should also be able to report other users for abuse/harassment.  

The website needs to be visually appealing; preferably with different icons for buttons that have the same function in different boards.  For example,
on a video game board there may be a symbol similar to a "1-up" mushroom instead of a thumbs up to notate how many "likes" each post or comment has.

The website will also force the user to create an account/password which will be stored in a database.

If time permits, the following features will be added: A mobile app that allows the user to be able to browse the threads with a UI that is better
suited for mobile devices, Instant messaging between users, and the ability for users to create their own boards.
