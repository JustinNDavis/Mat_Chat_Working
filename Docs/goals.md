#Purpose: the purpose is to identify my MVP, Full, and stretch goals for my project

Minimum viable product-
At a minimum, the website should have a catchy url/name that is immediately recognizable once you have seen the site. It needs to have 5 different
boards for users to browse and post through.  It should have clear rules. Having some sort of database connnection is a must, as information should
be archived to be viewed at a later time.  Users will be able to browse the site and read any content that's posted, however it will be a requirement 
to create an account and use the account to post anything.  The necessary pages for the site are video games, technology, fitness, sports, and anime.

Full-
The full product will have more features such as the ability to ban certain users for not following board rules.  Each page will have a specific artstyle
that sets it apart from the rest.  The login and account creation should be completely worked out.  Users will be able to "thumbs up" and "thumbs down"
posts and comments.  Posting should be easy and simple, encouraging users to engage.  Board rules should be posted on every board.  Each board will be
comprised of "threads" that users can expand and view.  The 3 most recent threads and the 3 most recent comments for the thread will be displayed on
 the main page of the board.  Older boards can be accessed by scrolling through the other pages. Once a thread reaches page 10, it will be deleted.
The following media types will be supported:
webm
jpeg
png


Stetch-
The stretch goal for this project is to be able to assign certain permissions to trusted users (known as user moderators).  Moderators should be allowed
to ban others and delete certain posts if they are against the rules of the board.  Users will be able to modify certain buttons with their own images.
"Night mode" which applies a simpler, darker tone to the pages making it less strenuous on users' eyes.
